                        Hello herro! My name is Meg Shinagawa. Iâ€™m a YouTuber and developer based in Tokyo, Japan. 
                        Although video production and coding are two very different things, I approach both with 
                        the same goal: <strong>to empower people to express their authentic selves</strong>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Growing up in an international school in Japan, I was raised in a multi-cultural environment 
                        which allowed me to explore who I truly am freely. It taught me to think outside of my own 
                        cultural box and feel free to express my authentic self. I want to give that same sense of 
                        freedom to others around me. Whether that be through my videos on YouTube, or the tools I 
                        create using my coding skills, I want to empower everyone to live out their authentic identity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On my off time, I like to sing, draw, game, and skateboard!
                    </p>
